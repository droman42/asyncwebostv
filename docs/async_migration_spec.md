# Specification for Migrating `pywebostv` to Async

## Overview

The goal of this migration is to convert the `pywebostv` library from a synchronous to an asynchronous paradigm. This will improve performance, especially in I/O-bound operations, and align the library with modern Python async practices.

## Project Structure

- **New Repository**: Create a new repository for the async version to maintain a clean separation from the existing synchronous version.
- **Module Organization**: Organize the code into modules reflecting different components, such as connection, controls, and discovery.

## Asynchronous Design

### 1. Connection Handling

- **Async Connection**: Convert the connection process to use `asyncio` for non-blocking network operations.
- **Async Context Manager**: Implement an async context manager for handling connections, ensuring proper setup and teardown.

### 2. Control Interfaces

- **Async Methods**: Convert control interfaces (e.g., `MediaControl`, `SystemControl`) to async methods.
- **Non-blocking Operations**: Ensure all methods interacting with the TV are non-blocking.

### 3. State Management

- **Async State Updates**: Use async methods to fetch and update the TV state.
- **Periodic Updates**: Consider using `asyncio` tasks for periodic state updates.

## Error Handling

- **Robust Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for async operations using `try`/`except` blocks.
- **Logging**: Ensure all exceptions are logged appropriately for debugging and monitoring.

## Testing Framework

- **Async Testing**: Use `pytest` with `pytest-asyncio` for testing asynchronous code.
- **Mocking**: Use `unittest.mock` or `aioresponses` to mock network calls and simulate TV responses.
- **Test Coverage**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage for all async methods, including edge cases and error scenarios.

## Documentation

- **API Documentation**: Provide detailed documentation for the new async API, including usage examples.
- **Migration Guide**: Offer a guide for users transitioning from the synchronous version to the async version.

## Performance Considerations

- **Concurrency**: Leverage `asyncio` to handle multiple connections or commands concurrently.
- **Efficiency**: Optimize network calls and minimize latency by using async I/O.

## Deployment and Distribution

- **Package Management**: Use `setuptools` or `poetry` for packaging and distribution.
- **Versioning**: Start with a new versioning scheme to differentiate from the synchronous version.

## Next Steps

1. **Code Review**: Review the current `pywebostv` codebase to identify all blocking calls and areas for async conversion.
2. **Prototype**: Develop a prototype for one of the core components (e.g., connection handling) to validate the async approach.
3. **Iterative Development**: Implement the async conversion iteratively, starting with the most critical components.
4. **Testing**: Develop test cases alongside the implementation to ensure reliability and correctness.

This specification provides a comprehensive roadmap for migrating `pywebostv` to an async paradigm, focusing on modernizing the library while ensuring it meets the needs of its users.
